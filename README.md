# Personal Portfolio Website
this is a personal portfolio website that i built to showcase my growth and skills as a frontend developer
i followed a tutorial from youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4bzV9Uu7A), and added my own touch to it using knowledge that i already learnt.
i chose this tutorial as the result looked really beautiful and it was using different libraries that i did not use before, which was a learning opportunity for me.

## Tech Stack Used
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- EmailJS

### Future developments
- include a 'motivational quote of the day' using free APIs
- adding in more animations and animated components using other UI libraries
